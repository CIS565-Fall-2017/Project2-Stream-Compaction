**Overview**<br />
Overiew of the prefix scan, compaction, radix sort algorithms and their applications:
https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems3/gpugems3_ch39.html

**Highlights**<br />
Across all tests (scan, compact, radix), the CPU implementation beats out the GPU implementations for small data sets, as expected due to the host to device data transfer required for GPU implementations. Across all tests, data sets of size 65536 (or 2^16) seems to be when the GPU implementation perf matches that of the CPU, and after this point the perf gap is severe: 3.5x for radix sort, 5.3x for compact, and 6x for scan. The key to the "Efficient" scan implentation was to make sure you were only launching as many blocks as were required for the depth passes in both the up and down sweeps as well as making sure threads that were running were consecutive. 
<br />
The last few images are of the NSight debugger for the thrust kernel (its kernel info and its timeline). Looking at the timeline I was suprised to see how little of the time is spent actually doing compute work (the rest is memory related). Also, judging from thrust's kernel launch info, it is using shared memory. Perhaps it's using the optimizations mentioned in the GPU Gems 3 Ch. 39 article linked in the Overview section. Recursive calls are required for that implementation but I see no multiple kernel calls so I'm not quite sure what optimizations it's using.
