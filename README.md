## Details

This project implements and compares different algorithms for scan and stream compaction, both in GPU and CPU. In particular, it implements a serial version, a naive parallel version, a work efficient version and an implementation from the Thrust library.

## Note about Work Efficient implementation

My implementation of the Work-Efficient approach tries to reduce the amount of threads dispatched to do both the up and down sweep, and thus it performs better than the naive approach. This happens because occupancy is maximized and only threads that do useful work are running.

## Analysis

It is interesting to analyze the results both in debug and release mode, as some behaviours arise. In general, CPU < Naive < Work-Efficient, but the Thrust library implementation radically changes between both.

The relative performances seem to be uniformly correlated, exept for Thrust. I suspect this happens because the library does some precomputation and thus becomes faster after some iterations, as the next graph exemplifies. It is also probably faster than my work efficient implementation, as I didn't do any shared memory optimizations. A clear drop in execution time can be seen after the first Thrust run.

An example of running the algorithms with an array of the same size. Note how Thrust drops and performs better with time.

It is also useful to analyze the relationship between using power of two arrays or non power of two. Note that the Thrust pattern still emerges. Although the ratio is close to 1, the non power of two case definitely uses more memory than necessary and is going to impact the overall application.
