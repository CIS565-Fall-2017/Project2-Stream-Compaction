## Analysis
 ### Thrust
 As we can see, the thrust::exclusive_scan is rather time-costing compared with other methods. Even if I used device_vector to store the data, it is still the slowest. 
 But since I did not free the device_vectors, the non-pow2 as second round's speed is much faster. 
 I think the reason is, when calling thrust functions, it will apply for some blocks/threads inside the GPU, and will release later on. 
 Although I tried my best to avoid any read/write from CPU to GPU, the scan function still cost some time to arrange for some place. 
 
 ### Unfixed Known Bugs
  #### 1. When using multiple blocks, sometimes the result is not right. I think it is because __syncthreads() doesn't sync blocks?
  #### 2. Since I used only 1 block, when the SIZE is more than 1024(which is the limit), apperently the result is wrong. 
  #### 3. CPU performace is much better, and sometimes the calculating time doesn't always raise with the SIZE. 
           I think this is because the SIZE is still not large enough?
