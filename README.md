### Overview
This project provides an introduction to parallel algorithms on integer arrays
* Scan : Computes a exclusive sum of all integers that came before each element in the array
* Stream Compaction : Removes 0's from an array of integers
* Radix Sort : Sorts an array of integers from least to most significant bits 

### Parallel Algorithms
#### Naive Scan

The diagram below illustrates the naive parallel scan algorithm. It starts by adding adjacent values, and then adding those values, and so on. This requires log2n iterations, and also requires additional memory since the algorithm cannot work in place.

#### Work Efficient Scan

In contrast to the naive scan, the work efficient algorithm works in place. The idea behind this algorithm is to create a balanced binary tree of the input data (up-sweep) computing the partial sums at internal nodes, followed by a root-to-leaves sweep of this tree that builds the sum in place. An actual tree data structure is not required, as the structure can be flattened into an array.   

![](img/upsweep.jpg)

In the down-sweep stage, the root of the tree is replaced with *0* and at each step, the node of the current level is passed to its left child and the sum of its value and the left child is passed to the right, as seen below.

![](img/downsweep.jpg)

Each pass in up-sweep requires almost *n* iterations, so *n* threads must be allocated even if some threads will not be used, so can retire early. However, for down-sweep an additional optimization can be used to only allocated the needed number of threads per level.

Because the up-sweep and down-sweep algorithms rely on the size of the array being a power-of-two, non-power-of-two arrays must be right extended to the next largest power-of-two in order to maintain correct indexing.  

#### Stream Compaction

The stream compaction algorithm start by creating a temporary boolean array where each element is *1* if the value at that index in the input array is not zero and *0* otherwise. Next this boolean array is scanned using the implementation above. The result of the scan is the index into the final array, so if the value of an index in the boolean array is *1*, then the value at that same index in the input array can be placed in the final array at the new index specified by the scanned array.  

#### Radix Sort

The parallel implementation for radix sort begins similarly to the above stream compaction algorithm. First for bit *k*, a temporary boolean array *b* is created where is element is *0* if the *k*-th bit in the input array is *1* and visa versa. A scan is run on this boolean array. Next the total number of falses (or the number of values whose *k*-th bit is *0*) is calculated by summing the last element in the boolean array and the scanned result of this boolean array. This value is used to create another array *t* where each value at index *i* is equal to *i - s[i] + totalFalses* where *s* is the scanned array. The last array to be computed contains the indices of each input element in the array sorted by *k*-th bit. The values in this array are equal to *b[i] ? f[i] : t[i]*. While this algorithm requires multiple passes and new arrays, it is not necessary to allocate space for each step. Some steps can be done in place, and later steps can overwrite previous ones once they are no longer needed.

### Performance Analysis

| Scan for SIZE < 20K | Scan for SIZE > 4M | 
| ------------- | ----------- |
| ![](img/scan20K.png) | ![](img/scan4m.png) |

The CPU method on non-power-of-two arrays is faster than that for power-of-two arrays because the CPU performs serially, and the non-power-of-two arrays have 3 fewer elements, so it finished faster because it has 3 less iterations in for-loops. The difference in performance between these differently sized arrays on the GPU side is the opposite because warps are allocated for 32 threads, so non-power-of-two sized arrays cannot fill an entire warp. Thus not all threads are utilized and the warp has lower occupancy. For an array with 3 less elements than a power-of-two (as was tested here), the different is marginal. But the difference is much more apparent for arrays with 1 more element than a power-of-two. 

| Compact for SIZE < 20K | Compact for SIZE > 4M | 
| ------------- | ----------- |

The difference in performance between the CPU method, the CPU method with scan, and the GPU efficient method illustrates why different algorithms are required for parallel and serial executes. The CPU method with scan is a CPU version of the GPU efficient method. Without multiple threads running at once, the CPU version must rely on multiple for-loops, more than its compaction implementation without scan. Therefore it is the slowest of the methods.

| Radix Sort for SIZE < 20K | Radix Sort for SIZE > 4M | 
| ------------- | ----------- |

Much like scan and compaction, GPU radix sort performs faster for large array sizes even though parallel radix sort requires more sort passes becauce the GPU works on bits in order to benefit from scan whereas the CPU version works on digits in decimal. The CPU algorithm calculates the maximum value in the array to determine how many sort passes are required. The maximum number of passes the GPU could do on an integer array is 32, but since the CPU version only loops for the maximum number of digits. So for performance comparison sake, the GPU method takes the number of bits in the input array that contain 1s, and the calculation of the CPU maximum is not included in the time.  

### Q&A

#### Compare GPU Scan implementations to the serial CPU version?
The GPU version performs better for scan, stream compaction, and radix sort for large arrays (*SIZE < 2^[18]*). Since the intersection between the CPU and GPU methods occurs at the same sized array, it suggests that the slow GPU performance for small arrays is based on a overhead required for creating and distributing threads. One that is only surpassed with large arrays.  

#### Where are the performance bottlenecks?
For the work efficient implementation, the upsweep and downsweep kernel functions require a similar amount of time, because they have the same ratio of compute to memory instructions. Most time is spent in memory reads and writes, but since there are not many of either type of instruction, it is not possible to space out the memory instructions with computations. 

#### How does the GPU Scan implementation compare to thrust?
Thrust exclusive scan on power-of-two sized arrays performs poorly but consistently for most array size except the largest. The consistency indicates that the thrust implementation might have a large overhead. While other implementations' runtimes increase exponentially with array size, thrust with power-of-two arrays remains around 10ms for all array sizes. However, the thrust method on non-power-of-two arrays behaves more closely to the other gpu scan implementations with an exponential increase but with a much better performance. An explanation for the poor performance with power-of-two arrays might be that thrust implementation might allocate and compute on more memory with these sizes but not for non-power-of-two arrays - the opposite of what the work efficient method does. According to the Nsight performance analysis, thrust also has low warp occupancy (25%) and high number of required registers per thread (78), which could also explain the poor perform for these sized arrays. However, thrust makes good use of shared memory.
